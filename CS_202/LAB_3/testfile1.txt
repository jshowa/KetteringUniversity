Jacob Howarth: Inquisitive Programmer.

Hello my name is Jacob Howarth and I love programming. The intricacies
of programming and how it is used to solve problems is one of the biggest
advantages to programming. Not to mention the blend between creativity 
and logic, which are not always seen in the same light, occurs when one programs. 
In essence, programming is poetic in that a program is like a poem which expresses
the beauty of creativity and thought. It's a poem that delves deep into a minds
logic and helps a person unfold in new ways.
