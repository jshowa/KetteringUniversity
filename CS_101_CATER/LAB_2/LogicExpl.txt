There is a logic error within the program that if you input
more miles then the gallons in your tank size, it creates a negative
amount of gas remaining.

For example, 

when 10 and 100 are input for the arguments of MPG and tankSize
respectively, and 10000 miles is input for the distance traveled, a 
negative value is created for the gallons of gas remaining which isn't
possible.

Another instance is 0 is input for the MPG argument. When this occurs,
and you input any distance taveled and tanksize, -infinity is output
as the gallons remaining which is also illogical.

You can also input negative values for tankSize and MPG and the program
will run. This is not a logical statment.

Both of these statments can be fixed using statments and loops.

The runtime errors are discovered as follows:

1) ArithmeticError when dividing by zero:
This can be changed by changing ints to doubles and using a control
statment (i.e. if...else) to not allow MPG to be 0.

2) NumberFormatException when inputing decimal integers:
This can be changed by changing ints to doubles.

3) NumberFormatException when inputing letter characters:
This can be changed using some type of loop control statement

4) ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when no input for arguments is given:
This can be fixed by providing input.
