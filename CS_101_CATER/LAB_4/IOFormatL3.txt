Lab -- 3 Julian and Gregorian Julian Date Calculator


I/O Formats:


Input:

   The input for the program is prompted in the console using the scannner class. 
In the program, the scanner class was used to create an object of the scanner type 
called "input" and have it call methods pretaining to the specific variable data 
types. For example, if I wanted to call the scanner object for input on a year 
for a specific date, I would assign the variable year to "input.nextInt()" or 
Double or whatever data type the year was. I also used the scanner to read 
strings using the ".next()" method. For strings I created a string and 
assigned it to the "input.next()" method. After that, I created strings for both 
AD/BC and AM/PM for the era and times. I then compared these strings to 
the input with .equalsIgnoreCase(), for example string AD would be 
compared to the string that was assigned to input.next() by way of this syntax
"AD.equalsIgnoreCase(string variable assigned to input.next())". 
This checks whether a string equals another string, input from the console, 
that ignores the case of the string.

Output:

The output was generated using the System.out.print() class and method. 
This method allowed for strings to be read as well as variables and 
printed them in the console when results were needed.
