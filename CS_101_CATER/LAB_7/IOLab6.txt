Lab 6 -- Tortoise and Hare

I/O Formats:

Input:

There is no input directly from the client in the driver code. The input is a random number
generator from each objects class which is called by an instance of the object in the main method
driver code. The random numbers generated by the random number class compares the numbers to the
percent chance of each movement by the Tortoise and the Hare.

Output:

The output prints the current position of each Tortoise and Hare object after each loop iteration.
If the Tortoise and the Hare fall on the same square, an OUCH!!! statement is printed indicating the
Tortoise biting the Hare. The result of the race after 70 squares of movement or greater is printed and
stops the loop. This is all done using the System.out class and the print() method.
