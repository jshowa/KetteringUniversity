The electric field inside a conductor is zero because the charge
in a conductor distributes on the surface of the conductor. This
effectively creates a Faraday cage, shielding any object holding
charge inside a conductor from the outside dangerous voltages. I
have some flowers; they are red, orange, blue: Pineapples.
