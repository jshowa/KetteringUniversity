# README.TXT

This project is an HC12 ANSI-C project.

This example is running the "Demo" program on:
-the CodeWarrior HC12 Simulator, (choose "Demo (Simulation)" target),
-ICD12 P&E cables interface (ICD12, Cable12, Cable12HS, Multilink) (choose "Demo (P&E Multilink)" target),
-BDIK Abatron BDI1000 interface (choose "Demo (Abatron bdi1000)" target).


This program shows a combination of features of the debugger:

-when "Simulation" debugging with "SampleS12.io" (SCIs, RTIs, io PORTB pure simulation),
"Visualization Tool" interaction with program (Subscription / Each access refresh),
and usage of Terminal component in terminal emulation mode.

-when "real hardware" debugging (in BDM mode, via P&E cable or Abatron BDI), 
with "Visualization Tool" interaction (Memory/ periodical refresh), 
and usage of Terminal component in real terminal mode.


Hardware setup:
--------------

When using an Abatron BDI1000, please connect the BDI to the PC COM2 port. Indeed, the project
uses COM1 for Terminal communication with the microcontroller.
If you run this project on a M68EVB912DP256 mother board, jumpers J12 and J13 should be set 
to 1-2 position and a serial cable should be connected between the EVB com port (P1) and the PC COM1 port.


Folders used:
- Sources: contains your sources. It contains a 'main.c' as a base and 'isr_vectors'
  for cpu vectors mapping.
- Debugger Cmd Files: Here you can place your own specific debugger command
  files.
- Startup Code: Contains the startup code of the application. You may adapt it
  to your own needs, but in such a case make sure that you create a local copy.
- Prm: Linker parameter file used for linking. Note that the file used for the linker
  is specified in the Linker Preference Panel itself (<ALT-F7> or Edit->{Current Build Target Name} settings,
  while the project window is opened).
- Libs: contains the ANSI library to be linked with.
- Debugger Project File: This *.ini file is passed to the debugger/simulator
  as configuration file. It contains various target interface settings, and path
  information as well. This file can be edited from the simulator/debugger e.g. using
  File->Configuration in the simulator/debugger.

This project includes a burner command file (.bbl) in order to generate a 
logical SRecord file (.s19) and a physical/linear SRecord file (.phy).  
Remove this file from prm folder if no SRecord is needed.
