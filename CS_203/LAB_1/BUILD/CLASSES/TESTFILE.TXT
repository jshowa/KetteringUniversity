The commander in chief's priority is preventing another terrorist attack in the United States,
President Bush told CNN's "Larry King Live" Tuesday. "The most important job I have had
­­ and the most important job the next president is going to have ­­ is to protect the 
American people from another attack," Bush said. Accompanied by first lady Laura Bush
and engaging in a wide­ranging conversation with King, Bush also said that his
administration has been involved in stopping specific threats against the United States since
the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
